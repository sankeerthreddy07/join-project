# join-project
Density-optimized Intersection-free Mapping and Matrix Multiplication for Join-Project Operations
Overview of Project
The Project contains 3 Algorithms in total DIM3, SparseBMM algorithm and DenseEC algorithm.
All the files of the 3 algorithms are uploaded in the folder.

Softwares Needed:

* Microsoft visual studio code
* You need to have C compiler installed in your system.

Steps to run the code:
  1. open command prompt.
  2. Navigate to the path in which the file is located.
  3. type gcc -o dim3.exe dim3.c and press enter // here we are runnnig file named dim3.c in whichh we use dim3 algorithm to find resultant matrix.
  4. type dim3.exe and press enter
  5. Enter the dimensions of the matrixes
  6. The result matrix is displayed as output.
  7. Repeat the steps for other files in this repository i.e., sparse.c and dense.c we get the sparse and dense matrix as output.
